No man's sky,The original game (still funny)
No man's guy,The man who just hated other men
No man's site,The unvisited website lost in the mists of time
Snowman's sky,The terrorizing snow monster in the clouds
No can try,The game that's just not worth trying out
No man spy,The female spy agency
No man... why?,The co-worker asking you if you saw something strange
No man's dry,A man lost his dear towel
No man's goodbye,A man tries to say farewell to his deaf wife
Flow fan's fried,A strong cooling fan is overloaded and burns up
So damn fly,Just a really cool guy
No can pi,It's just impossible to remember all those decimals
Go and die,That's not an okay insult
Toe and thigh,The store that specialises in shorts and shoes
No ham's dry,They are still smoking the meat
No man's lie,You can't handle the truth
Foam and rye,Two parts of a good beer
Soul man Psy,The South Korean pop artist who switched genre
No man's tide,The day the sea level stayed at an all-time low
No men's ride,The women who went on a girls-only roadtrip
So tan guy,The man who spent the day in the sun
No man's thai,He's actually Vietnamese and is tired of your assumptions
Low and high,Either depressing drugs or a hilly road
Woman cry,Bob Marley's lesser-known song
Gnome and spy,The short infiltrator
No man's sigh,The hot new thing all the kids are talking about
